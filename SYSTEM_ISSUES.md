# System Issues and Action Items

## M-Pesa Integration & Token Transfer Issues (May 17, 2025)

### Issues Found:

1. **M-Pesa Sandbox API Errors**: 
   - The M-Pesa API is returning a 500 error on the STK Push query: "The transaction is being processed".
   - Despite this error, the actual M-Pesa payment (20 KES) went through successfully.

2. **Arbitrum USDC Token Transfer Failures**:
   - When trying to transfer USDC on Arbitrum after a successful M-Pesa payment, we encounter: "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance".
   - The platform wallet (0x182d87B8cb79D792d8E9bd9227cA645CA9F9263e) shows a balance of 9.83 USDC on Arbitrum.
   - However, attempts to transfer even a small amount (0.001 USDC) fail with balance errors.

### Likely Causes:

1. **M-Pesa API Issue**: 
   - The sandbox environment is returning errors due to configuration issues.
   - The system should be updated to handle these errors gracefully when the payment has actually gone through.

2. **Token Balance Discrepancy**:
   - There may be a mismatch between what our balance check function returns and the actual available balance.
   - The token contract address being used may be different from what the platform has funds in.
   - The platform wallet may not have transaction approval for the token.
   - There might be gas issues on the Arbitrum chain for token transfers.

### Action Items:

1. **For M-Pesa Integration**:
   - Implement robust error handling in the STK Push flow to handle 500 errors without failing the transaction.
   - Manually check M-Pesa transaction status when query fails.

2. **For Arbitrum USDC Transfers**:
   - Verify the correct USDC token contract address on Arbitrum (current: 0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831).
   - Verify platform wallet has sufficient ETH on Arbitrum for gas.
   - Ensure platform wallet has transaction approval for the USDC token.
   - Add better logging and error handling for token transfers.
   - Consider implementing fallback chains/tokens if primary choice fails.

3. **Immediate Fix for User with Pending Transaction**:
   - Add the appropriate amount of USDC (or alternative token) to the user's wallet from a properly funded wallet.
   - Update the transaction record in the database to 'completed' with the manual transaction hash.
   - Communicate with the user about the resolution and provide a transaction URL.

4. **Long-term Improvements**:
   - Implement better balance checks and wallet monitoring.
   - Create an alert system for low platform wallet balances.
   - Set up automated top-ups for platform wallets when balances fall below certain thresholds.
   - Improve error handling to provide clearer feedback to users.
   - Add comprehensive logging for all blockchain operations.
