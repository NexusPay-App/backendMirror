# NexusPay Platform Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the NexusPay platform to fix the onramp/offramp system and enhance the overall functionality and security.

## 1. Platform Wallet System

### 1.1 Dedicated Platform Wallet Service

We created a comprehensive platform wallet service (`src/services/platformWallet.ts`) that provides:

- Separation of main platform wallet and fees wallet
- Balance checking with caching
- Secure token transfers
- Transaction fee collection
- Wallet status monitoring
- Fee withdrawal functionality

This provides a robust foundation for handling the platform's cryptocurrency operations.

### 1.2 Admin Interface

Added administrative endpoints to:
- Monitor platform wallet balances
- Manage fees
- Track transaction status

## 2. Fixed Onramping Flow (Fiat to Crypto)

### 2.1 Improved Deposit Process

- Added balance checking before sending tokens
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Implemented proper transaction tracking through escrow records
- Added detailed logging for better debugging

### 2.2 Enhanced STK Push Webhook

- Improved webhook handler with more detailed transaction processing
- Added proper balance checking before token transfers
- Fixed token transfer implementation
- Enhanced error handling and status updates

## 3. Fixed Offramping Flow (Crypto to Fiat)

### 3.1 Complete Withdrawal Implementation

- Implemented the previously missing token transfer step
- Added balance checking to ensure sufficient funds
- Enhanced validation and error handling

### 3.2 Improved B2C Webhook

- Completely rebuilt the B2C webhook handler
- Added support for failed transaction refunds
- Enhanced error handling and transaction tracking
- Implemented proper escrow status updates

## 4. Enhanced Caching System

### 4.1 Redis-Based Rate Caching

Created a dedicated rates service (`src/services/rates.ts`) with:
- Distributed locking to prevent multiple API calls
- Proper TTL-based caching with Redis
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Rate monitoring and manual refresh options

## 5. Security Enhancements

### 5.1 User Roles

- Added role-based access control to the user model
- Restricted admin functionalities to admin users
- Protected platform wallet operations

### 5.2 Wallet Security

- Separated fee collection from main platform operations
- Added balance checking before transactions
- Implemented error handling for failed transactions

## 6. Setup and Management Tools

### 6.1 Platform Setup Script

Added a setup script (`src/scripts/setupPlatformWallet.ts`) that:
- Creates platform and fees wallets
- Sets up admin user
- Updates environment variables
- Provides clear next steps

## 7. Transaction Integrity

### 7.1 Escrow System Improvements

- Enhanced the escrow model for better transaction tracking
- Added proper status updates
- Included crypto transaction hashes
- Added timestamps for all state changes

### 7.2 Automatic Retry Mechanism

- Enhanced retry logic for failed transactions
- Added proper escrow record updates
- Implemented proper error handling

## 8. Implementation Notes

### 8.1 For Developers

The improvements include:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging
- Type safety throughout the codebase

### 8.2 For Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:
1. Run the setup script to generate platform wallets
2. Fund the platform wallet with sufficient tokens
3. Set up monitoring for wallet balances
4. Implement notification system for critical events (low balance, failed transactions)
5. Configure proper webhook URLs for M-PESA callbacks

## 9. Future Improvements

Additional improvements that could be implemented:
