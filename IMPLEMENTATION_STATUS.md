# NexusPay Implementation Status

## Recent Changes Implemented

1. **Transaction Queue System with Redis**
   - Created a priority-based transaction queue (high, normal, low)
   - Implemented batch processing for similar transactions
   - Added exponential backoff retry mechanism with jitter
   - Created a transaction status tracking system

2. **M-Pesa Payment Processing**
   - Updated M-Pesa webhook handler to immediately acknowledge requests
   - Decoupled M-Pesa callbacks from blockchain operations
   - Added a 'reserved' status to escrow model for better tracking
   - Improved error handling and logging

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Implemented more robust error types
   - Added detailed logging for easier debugging
   - Created reconciliation logging for audit purposes

## Current Issues

We're encountering TypeScript compilation errors that need to be fixed:

1. **Missing Utility Functions**
   - Created missing utility files in `/src/utils/`
   - Added promise utilities in `/src/utils/promises.ts`

2. **Redis Method Name Issues**
   - Redis method names should be lowercase (e.g., `lpush` instead of `lPush`)
   - Fixed in platformWallet.ts

3. **Type Handling for Errors**
   - Improved error handling with proper type checking for unknown errors

4. **TransactionLogger Module**
   - Created a standalone transaction logger module that avoids circular imports

## Next Steps to Complete Implementation

1. **Fix Remaining TypeScript Errors**
   - Review all files importing from platformWallet.ts to ensure proper imports
   - Complete the implementation of missing interface functions

2. **Test the Transaction Queue**
   - Use the test-server.js script to verify functionality
   - Simulate M-Pesa payments and blockchain transfers

3. **Redis Instance Setup**
   - Ensure Redis server is running locally or configure connection to remote Redis
   - Test queue operations with actual Redis instance

4. **Final Integration Test**
   - Test complete flow from M-Pesa payment to blockchain transfer
   - Verify status updates and error handling

## API Testing Guide

### Buy Crypto Flow
1. POST to `/api/crypto/buy` with:
   ```json
   {
     "cryptoAmount": 10,
     "phone": "254712345678",
     "chain": "celo",
     "tokenType": "USDC"
   }
   ```
2. Note the `transactionId` in the response
3. User completes M-Pesa payment on their phone
4. System receives callback on `/api/mpesa/callback`
5. Check status with GET `/api/transactions/YOUR_TRANSACTION_ID`

### Implementation Notes
- The M-Pesa webhook handler now immediately responds with a success acknowledgment
- Transaction processing is done asynchronously via the queue system
- Priority levels determine processing order (high transactions are processed first)
- Exponential backoff with jitter prevents thundering herd problem during retries
- Transaction status can be tracked throughout the entire process
